# trading101
The goal of this repository is to record the trading journey I went through. I am interested in trading not because I am crazy about money but I enjoy the feeling of tackling difficult problems. Predicting stock price change could be one of the toughest questions in the world since the smartest people are competing with each other every moment and finally the stock price becomes unpredictable. Therefore, tacking this level of a challenge brings tons of satisfication.

The algorithms here may focus on small amount of money (e.g., less than $100k) and a daily or weekly trading frequency.
